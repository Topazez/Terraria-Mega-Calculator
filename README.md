# Terraria-Mega-Calculator
https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Terraria_Wiki:Projects/Mega_Calculator
Link above for more information on the project. The github wiki has info as well.

Each python file in this project acts as its own function and will be desigend to do something spacific.
At the start of each file there is a explination of what the file does/will do.
Keep in mind that this is still heavly a work in progress and has no functional use at the time of writting this. 
The main problem faced during this project is getting the bot account marked as a bot by a memeber of the terraria wiki staff team. Any request made to the wiki via a program is capped at 500 responses. A work around is currently in development.

Current python modules used:
request
pywikibot
mwclient
