Link above for more information on the project. The github wiki has info as well.

Any code missing comments or that is poorly commented will be fixed in the next commit. I am bad at not commenting as I go so bare with me.

Each python file in this project acts as its own function and will be desigend to do something spacific.
At the start of each file there is a explination of what the file does/will do.
Keep in mind that this is still heavly a work in progress and has no functional use at the time of writting this.
